Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, this is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious.

He instantly remembered that Gandalf the wizard was going to have tea with him that day. To his great surprise, thirteen dwarves in addition to Gandalf ended up at his table that afternoon. Thorin and Co., as the dwarves called themselves, were in need of a fourteenth member of their group to assist them on their quest to get back gold and other riches the dragon Smaug had stolen from them. Bilbo obliged and accompanied the band of dwarves on their rescue mission. On many occasions during his journey, Bilbo wished that he were back home, but once his duty was complete, Bilbo never regretted going with the dwarves.With an unexpected ending and great descriptions, I would undoubtedly recommend this book. Despite a slow and boring beginning, I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Hobbit. I really liked how this plot was so unpredictable. Thorin and Co.'s journey took so many enexpected turns that it kept me on my toes and really into the book.","Bilbo Baggins the hobbit was just about to have his tea one Wednesday when suddenly his doorbell rang.

I read this book on a yearly basis and each year I am delighted and captivated by the world of Bilbo Baggins.Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the gold and mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon, Smaug. They have many adventures and mishaps on their journey to the lonely mountain including the climactic battle of five armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way which leads, not only to a rise in his stature, but also to a new adventure for his friends in ""The Lord of the Rings.""Tolkien is a master storyteller and the depth of his skill is best seen in this tale. In the following trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings"" the story is continued, but the sheer delight of ""The Hobbit"" is never fully recaptured. This collector's edition is beautifully bound.

It's one of my all time favorites, the paradigmatic story of romantic obsession (which, like all true romances, ends in betrayal or death--in this case, both).
