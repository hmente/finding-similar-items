185,551,"I was of a mind to think that influence was somewhat to do with merit, but that is only a part of it, this book shows you how to communicate better and to use better dialogue in doing so.","I only wish this book was in hardcover. It is one of my favorites. If you like vikings you will love this series. Even though I do not like paperback books, this one is a ""keeper""!",0.25
270,851,"To those of you who are wondering when Mr Manchester will release the third volume, it has in fact been written for a number of years. However due to the fact that the US and other governments are rather sensitive to the bombing of Pearl Harbour, and all of the secrets surrounding it, this third volume was never allowed to be released in America, England and I don't know where else. Very sad, as these were two of the best books I have ever read!","This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I will continue to be very grateful that I was able to get It as easily as I did.",0.25
271,556,"This book is the perfect follow up to the last two books. After the first two Harry Potter books I thought it couldn't get any better but, then came The Prisoner of Azkaban. I suggest you stick with the book because the first few chapters wont catch your I but once you get deep into the book its hard to put the book down. Rowling keeps you in suspense for at least ten chapters or more. There is alot of action ant different thing going on at one time but at the end it all comes together. You should expect the unexpected. This book keeps you guessing that is why it is hard to let go.",I highly recommend this book to anyone who has read the first two but if you have not you need to because it is one of the most well written seires i have ever read. The book starts off with frodo inside of the black gate finally but you wont get much more out of me your going to have to read it yourself. It may start slow in the first two or three chapters but after that you will not be able to put it down. So get out there and read this book.,0.25

328,805,"I am not a marketing person and I seldom read non-fiction, but I found this book to be 1) very informative 2) easy to follow the logic 3) diverse examples of the authors point and 4) fairly well written. I found the book so interesting, I read it in 3 days.","I am not a big fan of the Contemporary Fiction - Dysfunctional Family genre of fiction, a genre that sadly dominates American literature. For me, a contemporary work in this genre needs to be exceptional to even crack a 3 rating.The Corrections is one of those exceptions. The genre is so, so tired, but the Corrections is so masterfully written, both on a level of prose and in the realistic construction of the protagonist family, that I have to give it a 4. This book is very well done.",0.25
344,370,"Decent book. Not a big fan of baseball, but it got me interested none the less. I like history and got this for a history class which compared baseball history and American history and how they influenced on another. If you like baseball or want to become more interest in it, I recommend this.","If you're a serious fan like me, especially if you do fantasy baseball, purchase this book. It is the most comprehensive text on the top prospects in baseball and a must have!I constantly refer back to it throughout the baseball season.",0.25

540,851,I have many books about Sinatra and this is one of the best. Richard Havers put together a wonderful read. The book combines his music and life very well in a chronological format.

170,342,"This book covers all topics you need to know for the exam in a compressed, but still relatively easy to comprehend way. (Of course it helps if you have some experience with VC++ 6). The pointers to what you should do / not do during the exam are to the point and helped me a lot. The sample questions are very much like the questions in the real exam. Actually in my case they were more difficult than the real questions asked! If you work your way through this book and manage to answer over 50-60% of the total correctly, you stand a good chance to pass the exam.It's definitely a book you should buy!","The Praxis Study guide for Music Content was a helpful source. I am taking the Praxis test tomorrow morning so we'll see if I actually pass or not. The practice test was shorter than the actual test and I have heard the questions on the practice test are much easier than on the actual exam. The book listed all of the topics that could be on the test, but the sheer amount was overwhelming and very little can be done to ""cram"" with this book. It does help some, and gives you a better understanding of what the test could be like.",0.24778761061946902

I will keep this book always and reread it every year. I highly recommend it to everyone.",I did not like this book at all until I reread the first few pages. I had to actually go back and read them over after putting the book down. I then read the whole hting in one sitting. I do not think everyone will like this book but I think if you can read it it is worth the read. My point is that although difficult to read it is worth the struggle.,0.24705882352941178

Each steps is clear and could be easy made.It's really a big help for me cause I always want to do my own collage but feel it's too hard to do.
